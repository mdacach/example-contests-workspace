Interesting problem. Split into cases, and go further. I stopped considering the solution too early, though it was feasible. 
It may not make sense immediately, but give it some thought. The solution may also not make sense if not considered fully.

1. Solve when best paths are the solution (this doesn't always work, but case 2 works when this does not).
2. Solve when they intersect

Struggled a bit, but made a lot of progress. Had a bit of trouble coding it, but not much.
