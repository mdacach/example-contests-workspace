Implementation, complexity analysis was a bit harder to see that it was OK. 
Got exposed to how to do this kind of mass erase from Sets in Rust. Still sub-par, but approachable (better than C++ anyway).

Not very hard problem, interesting "sanity-check".
Also possible to do with Union Find (DSU) -> clever definition of "parent" + path compression.
But I find the Set solution more intuitive.
