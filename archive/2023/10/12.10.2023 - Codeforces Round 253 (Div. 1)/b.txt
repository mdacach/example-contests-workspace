Tricky problem. Ended up with a correct _guess_, but struggled to code it.
I suspect a lot of people guessed it too, as the solution is quite simple, but the
proof requires some mathematics maturity. Stepping through the proof was pretty nice and the problem setup was pretty nice too.

Key takeaway is to come up with cleaner mathematical notations and pursue them.
