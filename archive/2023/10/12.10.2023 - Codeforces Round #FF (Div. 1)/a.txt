Longest subsegment strictly increasing, given that you can change a single number arbitrarily.
Initially thought of _subsequence_, which I think makes it much harder -> I should ask to see how to solve that one.

Straightforward problem, didn't struggle with it apart from the misunderstanding. Prefix sum to keep current good segments, 
iterate over the changed number.
