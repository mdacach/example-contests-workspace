Editorial's solution involves finding the diameter of a tree and is much simpler.
My solution Dynamic Programming on Trees - Reroot technique.
I had the idea somewhat quickly, spent some good time to nail the transitions on paper.
Idea was clear, but coding it was way too hard.
Some of the nodes had no possible answer (so I coded it as None). But then sometimes the node
would have answer 0 when it should have been None but *not always*. Sometimes 0 was a valid answer.
The code ended up absolute shit, 300 lines of ifs. I honestly don't know how it got AC, thank you Rust.
The idea was clear enough, though, so that's nice.

Good:
I had the (not easy) idea quickly.
I first transcribed the transitions on paper (and pseudocode).
Bad:
Did not think too much in terms of actually implementing it (due to Optional values).
Spent a long time coding.
Missed the easier editorial solution.

Should be more aware of implementation details next time.

P.S. I am getting good on DP on Trees :D Thank you AoJ.
