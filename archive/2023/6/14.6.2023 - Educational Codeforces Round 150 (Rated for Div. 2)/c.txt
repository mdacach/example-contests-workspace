Solution was much easier with DP.
I initially coded it as a brute-force:
- For each possible change, what would happen to the overall sum?
But then we need to consider what changes on the prefix and on the suffix.
It ended up being way more complicated and took a long time to code.
I should have:
1. Identified that the code was too complex
2. Think about other ways to code/other ideas
