Nice Dijkstra + shortest paths problem. We initially had the correct idea, but missed that
the number of shortest paths could be big (overflowed i32). Spent some time trying to figure out
why it was wrong.

Good:
Nice problem, we discussed it on the board.
Coded Dijkstra nicely with Rust's Reverse.
Bad:
Missed the overflow detail (I even knew that the number of shortest paths could be huge, but did not notice here).
