Initially did not see that the string was only 'a' or 'b'. Was thinking of some complicated stuff with palindromes.
Then had some good observations somewhat quickly. Thought about code on paper.
Had a good idea of how to code it up, but even then I missed some details.
There was one more observation that would make it much easier - Process from left to right, now you only care about indexes.

Good:
Got the idea quickly, did not get overwhelmed with many sub-problems.
Bad:
Was hard to code, and missed a detail I would get if reviewing calmly (my total was wrong).
Code could have been better if I did not copy-paste so much. I did not want to think too much about abstraction because the benefits
    are generally not great in CP. In this case, maybe coding it a bit better would end up saving time and effort.
I saw the tag by mistake (specifically I saw the *lack* of tags such as Data Structures). So I knew the solution would not be some weird stuff.

Consider refactoring/copy-pasting more carefully.
